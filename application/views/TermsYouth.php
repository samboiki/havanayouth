 The employee’s services may be terminated by either the employee themselves or the employee as set out in the Labour Act.

The employee shall, after following the Disciplinary procedures, be entitled to terminate the employee’s services with prior notice, in the following circumstances but not limited to the following circumstances, where the employee:<br/>

6.1 Being found guilty of any breach of his agreement, or misconduct or neglect in
the discharge of duties;<br/>
6.2 Disobeys any lawful order or directive from the employer<br/>
6.3 Being convicted of a schedule one criminal offence, e.g. fraud, theft, arson,
rape, assault, etc. In terms of the Criminal Procedures Act, as amended,<br/>
6.4 Being found guilty of any other conduct that would justify summary dismissal.
House Rules<br/>

In the interest of good order and in order to eliminate any conflict during the Domestic employee’s employment the employer has compiled the following House Rules, which must be adhered to by all domestic employees:

-	The purpose of having a domestic worker is to have a clean house and order at all times.
-	 Good service is rewarded with full monthly, weekly or once off payment in terms of the regulations of the Namibian Labour Act.
-	The employee is expected to wear suitable clothing when working at the house.
-	A Performance Bonus will be at the discretion of the employer to be paid after every 12 months for excellent service provided if approved by the employer.
-	These Rules are merely a guide and do not cover all the situations that the domestic employee might find him or herself in. Therefore, the domestic employee is encouraged to ask the employer whenever he / she is unsure of how to handle a particular situation.
-	Any transgression of any of these Rules might lead to disciplinary action being taken against the employee. The employer will adopt corrective and progressive discipline approach that will involve a system of graduated disciplinary measures such as counselling and warnings. Dismissal will be reserved for cases of serious or repeated misconduct. However, in certain instances a first transgression might be serious enough to justify dismissal for a first offence.

<h4>SAFETY AND SECURITY</h4>

6. The employee must not let anyone who is doing deliveries into the house unless he/she has been told by the employer that such person will be arriving and may be let in.
